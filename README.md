# Airport-Management-System

Airport management system primarily deals with
flight ticket booking, employees working in the airport, and shops. The system provides broad
overview of underlying operational factors that influence the airport management. The database
system consists of all the flight details, booking details, passenger details, shop details and
employee details.
Every flight is identified uniquely by a flight id. Flight id is a specific number designated to each
flight. Similarly, every passenger also has a unique id with which they can login into the booking
portal after registering themselves.
A unique feature of our application is that it shows the list of shops in the airport. One can also
search for a shop according to the type of product they wish to purchase and each shop has it's
own unique shop id.
One more unique feature of our application is admin login. Only the admin can add or delete one
employeeâ€™s details.
